# personal-banking

A personal project that I was working on before Erasmus in order to manage my expenses through Paypal and my two bank accounts. 

I got temporarily bored with this project, especially after noticing how weirdly restrictive the PayPal API was. For now, this is on hold.

The original idea was to eventually generate a CSV file with all the transactions performed in each account, a general balance, a change from the previous month, etc...

## TODO:
- [ ] Create script to manage the initial setup
- [ ] Create config file
- [ ] Rework banking API model, it should be only "banking-api" generally.
- [ ] Implement Paypal API access
